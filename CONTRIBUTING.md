- Stick to Code conventions listed below.
- Change the code and comment the changes exhaustively.
- Open a PR with the clear explanation of what you've done.
  
## Code conventions
- Every loop body is indented by one more space than the outer code.
  - Matching brackets have the same indentation.
- Every semantically separate piece of code is put onto the line of their own.
- Comments start with semicolon(s), as in Assembly or Lisp.
  - Three semicolons are a comment for a block of code.
  - Two semicolons are comments for a line or a small block,
    standing on a separate line.
  - One semicolon is a line comment just after the code.
  - Comments always end with a newline. No comment-code mixing.
  - As the only exception, put the file-level comment into a comment loop, conventional for other BF codebases.
